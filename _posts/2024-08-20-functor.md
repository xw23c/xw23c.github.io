## Definition
Functor extends the concept of function by saying anything behave like a function is a function.
A functor is a design pattern in programming that represents a function as an object. It is a way to package a function and its associated data into a single unit, allowing the function to be treated as an object.
In essence, a functor is an object that:
**1** **Wraps a function**: A functor contains a function as a member variable.
**2** **Provides a way to apply the function**: A functor provides a way to apply the wrapped function to a set of inputs, often through an apply or call method.
**3** **Can be treated as an object**: A functor can be passed around, stored, and manipulated like any other object.

> ##### TIP
> Functor is a class or struct object that can be called like a function. It overloads the **function-call operator** () and allows us to use an object like a function.
{: .block-tip}

```cpp
class X {

public:

    X(int i) {}

    void operator()(string str) {
        cout << "Calling functor X with parameter " << str << endl;
    }

    operator string () const {return "X";}  // type conversion function

};
```

```cpp
  X foo(8);
  foo("Hi!");
```

## Benefits of using functor
As object, functor can provide more things,  often used in functional programming to:

- **Enable parameterized function**: defining its own member data to remember  states such that different function instance can be created
- **Abstract away low-level details**: Functors can encapsulate complex logic and provide a simple interface to interact with it.
* **Enable function composition**: Functors can be combined to create more complex functions.
* **Improve code reuse**: Functors can be reused in different contexts.

Due to those member data, you could have different instance of the same functor that behave different from each other.
Regular functions are differentiated and identified by their function signatures. However,  two functors can be of different types even if they have the same function signature.

### Parameterized Function<!-- {"fold":true} -->

```cpp
/* Template way to parameterize the function
*  downside: temporary variable val has to be resolved at compile
*  time, i.e being a conpile time constant
*/


template<int val>
void addVal(int i){
    cout << val + i << endl;
}


/* Use Functor */

class AddVal {

int val;

public:
    AddVal(int j) : val(j) {}
    void operator()(int i) {
        cout << val + i << endl;
    }

};


int main(){

    vector<int> vec{2,3,4,5};

    int x = 2;
    // for_each(vec.begin(), vec.end(), addVal<x>); // compile error : x has to be compile time constant

    for_each(vec.begin(), vec.end(), AddVal(x)); // ok!

    return 0;
}

```


## Built-in functors [^2]
To use the predefined functors provided by the standard library by including the functional header file
`#include <functional>`

C++ provides the following library functors for arithmetic, relational, and logical operations:
- Relational Functors:
  `less, greater, greater_equal, less_equal, not_equal_to`
- Logical Functors:
  `logical_and, logical_not, logical_or`
- Arithmetic Functors:
  `multiplies, minus, plus, divide, modulus, negate`

```cpp
int x = multiplies<int>()(3,4); // x = 3 * 4

if (not_equal_to<int>()(x, 10)) // if (x != 10)
	cout << x << endl;
```

## Parameter Binding<!-- {"fold":true} -->

Combine functor with *bind* function :
```cpp
bind() // available c++11
bind1st() // c++03
bind2nd()
```


```cpp
set<int> myset{2,3,4,5};
vector<int> res;

transform(myset.begin(), myset.end(),        // source
    			back_inserter(res),              // destination
    			//bind2nd(multiplies<int>(),10));       // functor
    			bind(multiplies<int>(), placeholders::_1, 10));
			// bind() - c++11

// First element of multiplies is substituted by with myset`s element and second by 10
// res: {20,30,40,50}
```

## Functor composing
Construct composite functors using bind function :

```cpp

/*
*	 when (x > 2) && (x < 5) , copy from myset to res2_dq
*/

deque<int> res2_dq;

transform(myset.begin(), myset.end(), back_inserter(res2_dq),
            bind(logical_and<bool>(),
            bind(greater<int>(), placeholders::_1, 2),
            bind(less<int>(), placeholders::_1, 5))
        );

// c++11 Lambda function
transform(myset.begin(), myset.end(), back_inserter(res2_dq),
            [](int x){return x > 1 && x < 5;}
        );
```


## Function wrapper object [^3]
Convert regular function to functor. Use function class template to do so :
```cpp
std::function	// c++11
std::ptr_fun		// c++03
```

```cpp
deque<int> res_dq;
auto f = function<double (double, double)>(Pow);

transform(myset.begin(), myset.end(), back_inserter(res_dq),
    bind(f, placeholders::_1, 2.0));

```

(Details ref: [^3])


## Relational functor in STL
Ordered containers in STL are templates classes that initialized with relational functors, which are used for elements ordering. Default relational functor were usually set as `less`. On purpose of use case, we can customize this relational functor.

```cpp
class Lsb_less {
    public:
    bool operator()(int a, int b) {
        return (a%10)<(b%10);
    }
};

 set<int, Lsb_less> myset2{3, 1, 25, 7, 12}; // myset2 : {1,12,3,25,7}

```
