## What is data race
In C++, data race is a commonly occurring problem in concurrent programming. It occurs when two or more threads concurrently access the same memory location, and at least one of the accesses is a write. Data races lead to undefined behavior, which means the program can exhibit unpredictable behavior, crash, or produce incorrect results.

## Mutual exclusion with RAII
Use `mutex()`  to synchronize the access to common resource. The name *mutex* comes from mutual exclusion. However, we should avoid to use the mutex directly since it is not *exception-safe*. Instead,  the RALL(Resource Acquisition is Initialization) approach is recommended, which will wrap the mutex and it will aways get guaranteed to be unlocked after the wrapper guard gets out of scope.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <string>
#include <mutex>

using namespace std;


std::mutex mu;

void shared_print(string msg, int id) {

    /* As follows avoiding use std::mutex directly which is not exception safe.
    Instead, use std::lock_guard according to RAII.
    */


    //RAII, when guard goes out of scope, the mutex always gets unlocked automatically
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(mu);


    // mu.lock();
    cout << "[ID-" << id << "]" << msg << id << endl;
    // mu.unlock();
}



void func_1() {
    for (int i=0; i>-100; i--) {
        shared_print(string("From child_t: "), i);
    }
}


int main() {

    std::thread child_t(func_1);

    for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
        shared_print(string("From main: "), i);
    }

    child_t.join();
    return 0;
}


```

Even though we adopt RAII above, there still be one pitfall. That is the *cout*, which is not completely under the protection of mutex *mu* since it is a global variable and other thread still can use it directly without going through the mutex lock.

## Resource bundled mutual exclusion (RBMutex)

To make the resource fully protected, we exploit resource instantiation and bundle it together with the mutex lock.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <string>
#include <mutex>

using namespace std;


class LogFile {
	std::mutex m_mutex;
	ofstream f;

public:
	LogFile() {f.open("log.txt");}
	void shared_print(string, int) ;
	~LogFile() {f.close();}

};


void LogFile::shared_print(string msg, int id) {

	/* As follows avoiding use std::mutex directly which is not exception safe.
	Instead, use std::lock_guard according to RAII.
	*/


	//RAII, when guard goes out of scope, the mutex always gets unlocked automatically
	std::lock_guard<std::mutex> guard(m_mutex);


	// mu.lock();
	this->f << "[ID(" << id << ")]" << msg << id << endl;
	// mu.unlock();
}



void func_1(LogFile& log) {
	for (int i=0; i>-100; i--) {
		log.shared_print(string("From child_t: "), i);
	}
}


int main() {

	LogFile log;
	std::thread child_t(func_1, std::ref(log));

	for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
		log.shared_print(string("From main: "), i);
	}

	child_t.join();
	return 0;
}

```


Keep in mind that never to leak the resource to the outside world. Following are examples considered as bad implementation:

```cpp
class LogFile{
	std::mutex mu;
	ofstream f;

public:
	...

	// Bad idea to return f to outside world
	ofstream& getStream() {return f;}
	// Bad idea to pass f as argument to user-provided function
	void processf(void func_user(ofstream&)){
		func_user(f);
	}

};
```
