## Overview [^1]

There are two types of concurrent programming model: multi-processing and multi-threading.
Comparing to multi-processing, the multi-threading characterize:
- Pros
  - fast to start
  - low overhead
- Cons
  - difficult to implement
  - cannot run on distributed system

Example code of threading:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<thread>
using namespace std;

void function_1(){ cout<<"Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one." <<endl;};

int main() {
	std::thread t(function_1); // t starts running
	// t.join(); // main thread waits for thread t to finish
	t.detach();	// t goes freely on its own -- daemon process

	/* join or detach can only operated once
	 cannot join anymore once get detach */

	// check if joinable
	if (t.joinable()) t.join();

	return 0;
}
```


## Thread management [^2]

### Try-Catch block
Child thread destroyed (eg. thread goes out of scope) before `.join/.detach` , the program then terminates. This can be caused by exceptions from the parent thread. To avoid this problem, one solution is to use try-catch block.

```cpp
void function_1(){ cout<<"Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one." <<endl;};

void parent_thread_works() {
	for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
	cout << "from main: " << i << endl;
	}
}

int main() {
	std::thread t(function_1); // t starts running

	/* Use try-catch to wrap up the parent thread`s work.
	This will ensure the child thread to be joined w/wo
	exceptions */
	try {
		parent_thread_works();
	} catch (...) {  // catch any exceptions
		t.join();
		throw;
	}

	/* Another way is to use RAII, create wrapper class w(t)
	whoes destructor will join t automatically*/

	t.join();

	return 0;
}
```



### Pass by reference

```cpp
class Fctor {
public:
	void operator()(string& msg) {
	cout << "t says: " << msg << endl;
	}
};

int main() {
	string s = "Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.";

	cout << "ID of main thread" << std::this_thread::get_id() << endl;

	// another pair of parathesis added to explicily declare Fctor()
	// constructed as a functor
	std::thread t((Fctor()), std::ref(s));

	cout << "ID of child thread: " << t.get_id() << endl;

	t.join();

	// child and parent thread sharing the same memory, ie. the string s
	cout << "from main: " << s << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

As in above example, though we have `string& msg`  in declaration, the `thread()` constructor will still take in value. So it still keeps as passing by value. To force using pass by reference, we use
> `std::ref(s) // Create a reference wrapper`

### Pass by pointer
Note in the example, parent and child share the same memory, the string *s*. Suppose we don’t prefer this way, since memory sharing causes data racing problem. And we don’t prefer to pass data by value. In such case we can pass parameter use the `move()` function
> `std::move(s) // move the string s from the main thread to the child thread`
In Cpp there many things can only be moved and cannot be copied, such as the thread object
```cpp
int main() {
	string s = "Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.";

	std::thread t((Fctor()), std::move(s));

	//std::thread t2 = t; // cannot compile
	std::thread t2 = std::move(t);

	t2.join();

	return 0;
}
```

### Identification
Following functions can be used to display the thread id
> `std::this_thread::get_id() // id of current thread`
> `thread_t.get_id()          // id of thread t`

### Oversubscription
Ideally we create number of threads as many as the number of cores we have. To run more threads than hardware support is called *oversubscription*, which will create lots of contact switching and decrease the performance.
The library provides function that give indication how many threads should be truly used for concurrency:

> `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`
